# About This Project
I started this project because I wanted to combine the CS basics I learned with the new AI technology I was curious about.
What I built:
A standard Student Management System. I deliberately chose not to use Python's built-in functions for sorting. Instead, I manually wrote the QuickSort algorithm to practice data structures and logic.
I wanted to control the system using natural language (e.g., "Add a student named John"). So I integrated ChatGLM2-6B to parse these commands.
Note:
While I wrote the core system logic myself, I used AI tools to help generate the boilerplate configuration for PyTorch and LoRA, which helped me speed up the environment setup.
